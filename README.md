# Individual Antibiotic Treatments

The general aim of this project is to design optimal individual (that is, personalized) antibiotic treatments based on microbiota composition to reduce resistance. Here we test the effects of time-dependent versus concentration-dependent antibiotics on bacterial communities with only two different bacteria species, called commensal and pathogen.

## Getting Started

The code was build in Julia version 0.5.1 and requires Gadfly, ODE, Distributions, DataFrames, JLD packages to be installed. There are
