# Testing the effect of time-dependent versus concentration-dependent antibiotics

The general aim of this project is to design optimal individual (that is, personalized) antibiotic treatments based on microbiota composition to reduce resistance. Here we test the effects of time-dependent versus concentration-dependent antibiotics on bacterial communities composed of two different bacteria species, called commensal and pathogen.

## The mathematical model
